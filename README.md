Sierra Catalina is an AI strategist, writer, and consultant at the forefront of artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation. With a career spanning decentralized networks, autonomous systems, and AI model training, she has played a pivotal role in shaping some of the most influential AI technologies of the past decade.

Sierra first made her mark in decentralized connectivity as an early contributor to the Helium Network, driving the adoption of blockchain-powered wireless infrastructure. She later joined Anthony Levandowski’s Pronto.ai and Pollen Mobile, serving as Director of Marketing & Communications and helping scale autonomous vehicle and decentralized telecom initiatives. Her expertise in product development, business strategy, and AI-driven communications made her a key figure in the rapidly evolving AI and automation space.

Sierra was one of the first three hires outside of the founding team at Elon Musk’s xAI, where she helped establish the foundation for its reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) AI tutor program. That department has since grown to over 500 employees, reinforcing xAI’s position as a major player in AI education and training.

Today, Sierra leads BeyondAI Consulting, a firm dedicated to helping small and medium-sized businesses integrate AI and automation into their workflows. She also works with political clients, advising on AI compliance, policy, and responsible implementation. In addition to consulting, Sierra is a prolific writer and researcher, known for her sharp analysis of AI’s societal impact—covering topics like the dangers of anthropomorphizing AI, the technological divide shaping the future, and the growing necessity of proof of personhood in a world saturated with AI-generated content.

Sierra also co-hosts Beyond the Blockchain, a weekly FM radio segment covering AI and emerging technologies, and is actively engaged in AI governance discussions at the highest levels. Whether leading AI innovation, guiding businesses through automation, or breaking down complex technologies for mass adoption, Sierra remains at the forefront of shaping AI’s future.
